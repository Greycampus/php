### 5. Operators:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHP language supports following type of operators.
  - Arithmetic Operators 
  - Comparison Operators 
  - Logical (or Relational) Operators 
  - Assignment Operators 
  - Conditional (or ternary) Operators 

#### 5.1. Arithmetic Operators

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are following arithmetic operators supported by PHP language :

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| + | Adds two operands |
| - | Subtracts second operand from the first |
| * | Multiply both operands |
| / | Divide numerator by de-numerator |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division |
| ++ | Increment operator, increases integer value by one |
| -- | Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one |

#### 5.2. Comparison Operators

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are following comparison operators supported by PHP language

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| == | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true |
| != | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true |
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true |
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true |
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true |
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true |

#### 5.3. Logical Operators

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are following logical operators supported by PHP language

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| and |If both the operands are true then condition becomes true |
| or | If any of the two operands are non zero then condition becomes true |
| && | If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true |
| &#124; &#124; | If any of the two operands are non zero then condition becomes true |
| ! | If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false |

#### 5.4. Assignment Operators

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are following assignment operators supported by PHP language
 
| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| = | Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand |
| += | It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand |
| -= | It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand |
| *= | It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand |
| /= | It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand |
| %= | It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand |


#### 5.5. Conditional Operator

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more operator called conditional operator. This first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then execute one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation. <br/>
syntax: ? :<br/>
``` If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y ```
